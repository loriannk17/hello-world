# hello-world

Hello everyone! 

My name is Loriann. I am an aspiring technical writer looking to build a strong portfolio that will allow me to break into the industry. I have my BA in English and have some experience writing SOPs and editing software proposals. I love a challenge- I'm addicted to learning! I love to write, read, and sing and I'm obsessed with my man and my puppy.
